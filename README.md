# June outline:

Topic: Hardware infrastructure

Talking points:

1. The OG of blockchain

  - Satoshi Nakamoto: one-CPU-one-vote
  - One-CPU-one-vote: Proof of work
  - But how long can the growth continue?
 
 2. Well lets look at Moore's Law (not really a law) 
 
  - Started out as circuits would double every year until it reached 65,000 by 1975
  - Revised in 1975 to a doubling of transistors on a chip every two years... but we are running out of space

3. Bitcoin bros band together

  - Proof of work takes up more space and has needs for my computing power as time goes on
  - Add GPUs to CPUs
  - Mining pools spread out the workload but it is not enough

5. Etherium says they will come to save the day!

  - You can use ETH for finance, NFTS (how many chickens y'all got now?), and more applications than bitcoin
  - BUT they see that Proof of Work isn't going to cut it anymore so they are moving to Proof of Work within the next few months (maybe, maybe not)
  - The switch to Proof of Stake will temporarily fix the problem of scaling up but will create a new problem... larger capital investment to gain access
  - You have to spend money to make money crypto edition. What about the little guys?

6. So what are we doing now to try and fix these issues? What do we think will be created or implemented in the future to fix it?

  - You and Jessie were arguing about what you are working on right now (insert plug for that here)
  - Posturing and bullshitting like y'all do best

*With this we can figure out who to bring in for each episode that can speak to the subject matter at hand*
